# Ahar Setu 🍱

Ahar Setu is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between food donors and NGOs, ensuring that surplus food reaches those in need. It enables real-time coordination to reduce food wastage and feed the hungry.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Despite having surplus food available from households, events, and businesses, countless people go hungry daily. Due to the absence of a centralized coordination system between donors and NGOs, this surplus food often goes to waste.
